## About Me

My name is Zhenning Li, I was born in Shandong Province in 1991. 

I am now a Ph.D student majoring in meteorology, using models and high performance computing clusters to simulate weather and climate. Meanwhile, I like coding, reading, and watching movies. Recently, I am taking more interests in the global economic system and fintech, and trying to build my own algorithm trading system.
