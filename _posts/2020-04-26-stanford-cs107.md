### L1: Administrative Details

#### Notes

* C
* Assambly
* C++
* Concurrent Programming
* Scheme
* Python

C is more procedure-oriented, from main to sub function, and sub function to sub-sub function. "Procedure Paradiam"

Concurrent programming issue: The shared resource that two different processes to access to.

Scheme is in functional paradiam: rely on a return from a function to move forward! Thus you can program without side effects.

e.g. side effects in C/C++: Pass a data structure into a function by reference, and change it in the function, when return, it changed.

Python, with good web libraries.


#### Qustions

* Here talking about concurrent programming in one CPU? Seemingly in a Time-sharing system.

### L2: C/C++ Data Types - Interpretations

#### Notes

Low-level memory mechanisms.

C/C++ Data types
|Data Type|Length|
|----|----|
|bool|1 byte|
|char|1 byte|
|short|2 byte|
|int|4 byte*|
|long|4 byte|
|float|4 byte|
|double|8 byte|

Technically, a Boolean can be mapped by a single bit in memory. Can engineer the compiler to do so.

Considering sign, the first bit in 1 --- minus sign.

When 0000 0000 0000 0111 + 1000 0000 0000 0111, if the first bit is sign, the result is not right.
To deal with this problem, use invert + 1 to represent negative values. [Two's complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement)

```C
char ch = 'A';
short s = ch;
cout << s << endl;

OUTPUT:
65
```

> ch      |_65_|
> s  |____|_65_|

```C
int i = 2^21+2^10+2^1
short s = i

OUTPUT:
1026
```

```C
short s = -1;
int i = s;
```
> s |1111 1111|1111 1111|
> i |1111 1111|1111 1111|1111 1111|1111 1111|

Floating things are wierd. See [IEEE 754](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754)

Float (32 bits/ 4 bytes):
