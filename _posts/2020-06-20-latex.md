Latex is something very useful that you only take 30 minute to learn and benefits from it through all your career. Here we hope to use Latex to replace MS word to create docs that need regular modifications, e.g. CV and bio.


### Notes

#### [Overleaf tutorial](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes#What_is_LaTeX.3F)

Beginner example:

```tex
\documentclass{article}

\begin{document}
First document. This is a simple example, with no 
extra parameters or packages included.
\end{document}
```
>The first line of code declares the type of document, known as the class. The class controls the overall appearance of the document. Different types of documents will require different classes i.e. a CV/resume will require a different class than a scientific paper.
