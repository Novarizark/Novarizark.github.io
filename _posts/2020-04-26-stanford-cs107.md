### L1: Administrative Details

#### Notes

* C
* Assambly
* C++
* Concurrent Programming
* Scheme
* Python

C is more procedure-oriented, from main to sub function, and sub function to sub-sub function. "Procedure Paradiam"

Concurrent programming issue: The shared resource that two different processes to access to.

Scheme is in functional paradiam: rely on a return from a function to move forward! Thus you can program without side effects.

e.g. side effects in C/C++: Pass a data structure into a function by reference, and change it in the function, when return, it changed.

Python, with good web libraries.


#### Qustions

* Here talking about concurrent programming in one CPU? Seemingly in a Time-sharing system.
