### L3: Converting Between Types of Different Sizes and Bit Representations Using Pointers 

#### Notes


##### Forced Type Conversion

```cpp
double d=3.1416;
char ch=*(char *)&d; // 1. &d get d ref --> 2. (char *) use char point to &d --> 3. * deref by `char`
```

Another dangerous test:

```cpp
short s=45;
double d=*(double *) &s;
```

Note `double` need 8 bytes to store the value, while short only takes 2 bytes, so this operation is very dangerious.

**Big Endian and Little Endian:** 

See this plot:

If copy a `short` type 1 from Big Endian machine to Little Endian machine, it will give a 256. Not a problem in forced type conversion.

###### Struct

```cpp
struct fraction{
    int num;
    int denum;
};

fraction pi;
```

pattern:
```
||||pi.denum
||||pi.num
^
|
pointer
```
