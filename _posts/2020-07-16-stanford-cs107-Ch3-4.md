### L3: Converting Between Types of Different Sizes and Bit Representations Using Pointers 

#### Notes


##### Forced Type Conversion

```cpp
double d=3.1416;
char ch=*(char *)&d; // 1. &d get d ref --> 2. (char *) use char point to &d --> 3. * deref by `char`
```

Another dangerous test:

```cpp
short s=45;
double d=*(double *) &s;
```

Note `double` need 8 bytes to store the value, while short only takes 2 bytes, so this operation is very dangerious.

**Big Endian and Little Endian:** 

See this plot:

If copy a `short` type 1 from Big Endian machine to Little Endian machine, it will give a 256. Not a problem in forced type conversion.

###### Struct

```cpp
struct fraction{
    int num;
    int denum;
};

fraction pi;
```

pattern:
```
||||pi.denum
||||pi.num
^
|
pointer
```
See the quirky syntax:

```cpp
(fraction*)(&pi.denum))->num=12
```

It first point to the original `pi.denum` (4 byte) and then interpret it to a fraction struct! What will happen? The orginal `pi.denum` is interpreted to a `<new_struct>` of fraction! Thus, <new_struct>->num=12 will change the original `pi.denum` value!


Null character `\0` or `NUL`
