### L3: Converting Between Types of Different Sizes and Bit Representations Using Pointers 

#### Notes


##### Forced Type Conversion

```cpp
double d=3.1416;
char ch=*(char *)&d; // 1. &d get d ref --> 2. (char *) use char point to &d --> 3. * deref by `char`
```

Another dangerous test:

```cpp
short s=45;
double d=*(double *) &s;
```

Note `double` need 8 bytes to store the value, while short only takes 2 bytes, so this operation is very dangerious.

**Big Endian and Little Endian:** 

See this plot:

If copy a `short` type 1 from Big Endian machine to Little Endian machine, it will give a 256. Not a problem in forced type conversion.

###### Struct

```cpp
struct fraction{
    int num;
    int denum;
};

fraction pi;
```

pattern:
```
||||pi.denum
||||pi.num
^
|
pointer
```
See the quirky syntax:

```cpp
(fraction*)(&pi.denum))->num=12;
```

It first point to the original `pi.denum` (4 byte) and then interpret it to a fraction struct! What will happen? The orginal `pi.denum` is interpreted to a `<new_struct>` of fraction! Thus, <new_struct>->num=12 will change the original `pi.denum` value!

Similar examples:
```cpp
((fraction*)&(pi.denum))->denum=33;
```

##### Array

Actually, we need to accept the concept that verything in C/C++ is pointer, look at array:

```
array<=>&array[0]
array+k<=>&array[k]
*array<=>array[0]
*(array+k)<=>array[k]
```

If do this:
```cpp
int array[10];
array[10]=1;
```

Be aware, this will not cause a compiler error as the C compiler is an efficiency-wise compiler, it will not do the bounce check.
array[10] will be interpreted by 10*sizeof(a[0]), which is 40. Thus, from `&array[0]` and count for 40 bytes, that 4-byte space will be set to 1.
This operation even tolerates negative numbers. **(This is just code, not good code!)**
The neighbouring address is highly possible to be other variables. See [activation record](https://wiki.c2.com/?ActivationRecord#:~:text=A%20data%20structure%20containing%20the,be%20partially%20stored%20in%20registers.).

The above code is equivalent to:
```cpp
*(array+10)=1;
```

There could be many crazy examples (Actually there is an error, you can find it):

##### Struct Array

Now we see the `struct`:

The corresponding bit patterns in memory:
KCwj.jpg](https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/08/06/aRKCwj.jpg)

Try this:
```cpp
pupils[2].name=strdup("Adam");
```
Here a `linked table` like thing will work:
![aRKa0H.jpg](https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/08/06/aRKa0H.jpg)

And this:
```cpp
pupils[3].name=pupils[0].suid+6;
```

You will see:
![aRMRxK.jpg](https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/08/06/aRMRxK.jpg)

Another one:
```cpp
strcpy(pupils[1].suid, "40415xx");
```

![aRQWYn.jpg](https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/08/06/aRQWYn.jpg)

Null character `\0` or `NUL`

Try a scary on:
```cpp
strcpy(pupils[3].name,"123456")
```

See the result:

##### Generic Swap **Important**

```cpp
void swap (int *ap, int *bp)
{
    int temp = *ap;
    *ap = *bp;
    *bp = temp;
}
int x=7;
int y=117;
swap(&7, &y);
```
See the flow:
